# Self-Hosted Install
This is something that has been thought about and has been baked into the app to make sure it could happen.    
The tool and API has been built with this aspiration in mind. Most things are configurable and libraries and technologies were picked due to their interropability.    

However, at present, I cannot support the tool, the online service and the extra demand a Self-Hosted version support would demand.    

That said, ping me and let me know you're interested. On a case-by-case basis and the demand has been validated I could make something work.
